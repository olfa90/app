# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# you can skip this first one if it is not already excluded by prior patterns
