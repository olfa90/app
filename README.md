# HOW TO RUN IT

To run the App in your mobile phone, first download the code in your computer and make sure you have phonegap installed and working (http://phonegap.com/install/).

After that, put your mobile phone in debugger mode, connect it via USB to your computer and run the following command in your terminal (make sure you are inside 'menu4tourist/app/menu4touristApp'):
> phonegap run android

If preview command didn't work, run this one to get your device code:
> adb devices

Then:
> phonegap run android --device=<device-code-here>


Now, just access the App Menu For Tourist installed in your mobile phone.

ENJOY! :D
